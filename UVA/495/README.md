Fibonacci Freeze 
================

The Fibonacci numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...) are defined by the recurrence:
	
	F0 = 0
	F1 = 1
	Fi = Fi-1 + Fi - 2 for all i >= 2

Write a program to calculate the Fibonacci Numbers.

Input and Output
----------------

The input to your program would be a sequence of numbers smaller or equal than 5000, each on a separate line, specifying which Fibonacci number to calculate.

Your program should output the Fibonacci number for each input value, one per line.

Sample Input
------------
	5
	7
	11

Sample Output
-------------

	The Fibonacci number for 5 is 5
	The Fibonacci number for 7 is 13
	The Fibonacci number for 11 is 89
