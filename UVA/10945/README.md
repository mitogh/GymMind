#Problem C: Mother Bear
![](img/beer.jpg)

Unforunately for our lazy "heroes", the nuts were planted by an evil bear known as.. **Dave**, and they've fallen right into his trap. Dave is not just any bear, he's a talking bear, but he can only understand sentences that are palindromes. While Larry was dazed and confused, Ryan figured this out, but need a way to make sure his sentences are palindromic. So he pulled out his trustly iPod, which thankfully have this program you wrote just for this purpose.. or did you? 


## Input 

You'll be given many sentences. You have to determine if they are palindromes or not, ignoring case and punctuations. Every sentence will only contain the letters A-Z, a-z, '.', ',', '!', '?'. The end of input will be a line containing the word "DONE", which should not be processed.


##Output

On each input, output "You won't be eaten!" if it is a palindrome, and "Uh oh.." if it is not a palindrome. 

## Sample Input

	Madam, Im adam!
	Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor.
	Me so hungry!
	Si nummi immunis
	DONE

## Sample Output

	You won't be eaten!
	You won't be eaten!
	Uh oh..
	You won't be eaten!
