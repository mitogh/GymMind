I. Behold My Quadrangle 
=======================

Context
-------

Any square is a rectangle, any rectangle is a quadrangle, and any quadrangle is composed of four sides. But not all rectangles are squares, not all quadrangles are rectangles, and not all sets of four sides are quadrangles.

The Problem
-----------

We have the length of four sides. You have to determine if they can form a square. If not, determine if they can form a rectangle. If not, determine if they can form a quadrangle.

The Input
---------

The first line of the input contains an integer indicating the number of test cases.

For each test case, there is a line with four positive integer numbers, between 0 and 230.

The Output
----------

For each test case, the output should consist of a line with the text "square", "rectangle", "quadrangle" or "banana", if the sides of the corresponding case can form a square, a rectangle, a quadrangle or none, respectively.
