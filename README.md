#Problems to train the mind, GymMind :)

This repo was created to training different skills, basically:
 - C (lovely C, I'll never let you go)
 - C++ (it's required)
 - Markdown
 - Better algorithms (I hope this one in particular)
 - VIM 
 - Git
 - English :P

Feel free to comment and of course to give some great feedback about my way to attack the problems.
